    <div class="tomy">My dearest Niña,</div>
    
    <p>I need to apologize for letting my insecurities get the best of me. I've been overthinking things so much lately, convincing myself that you might have feelings for William instead of me. I know this isn't fair to you or to us.</p>

    <p>My mind has been creating scenarios that probably aren't even real, and I've let these thoughts affect how I've been acting toward you. I'm sorry for any distance or tension this has caused between us. You don't deserve to deal with my unfounded jealousy and anxiety.</p>

    <p>The truth is, since you came into my life, everything has felt so real and beautiful. I care about you deeply, and that's probably why my overthinking has gotten so out of control. I promise to work on trusting what we have and communicating openly with you instead of letting my thoughts spiral.</p>

    <div class="signature">Love always,<br>Simon</div>
